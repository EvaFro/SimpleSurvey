## Requirements

An `nvmrc` file is included if using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

- Node v9.8.0

### Installing Dependencies & Executing Code 

From within the root directory:

```sh
npm install  // to install dependencies
npm start   // this will build public files and run server
```
* note this file can also be run with:

```sh
node server.js // this will build public files and run server
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser of choice. 

### Saved Data

From within the root directory:
- All data is being saved in the outPutData file: `./src/data/outPutData.txt`

If there were a database for this project. I would use a SQL database. This is because right now the form is basic,
however, if we wanted to save user profiles we would want to be able to have relational database in order to query profiles
related to specific results.
